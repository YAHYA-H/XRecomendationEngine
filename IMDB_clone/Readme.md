<li>Taking the functionalities of the chart one step further and building a knowledge-based recommender. This model takes user preferences with regards to genre, timeframe, runtime, language, and so on, and recommends movies that satisfy all conditions.</li>

#### The knowledge-based recommender

Build a knowledge-based recommender on top of our IMDB Top 250 clone(simple-recommdender). This will be a simple function that will perform the following tasks:

<li> Ask the user for the genres of movies he/she is looking for </li>
<li> Ask the user for the duration </li>
<li> Ask the user for the timeline of the movies recommended </li>
<li> Using the information collected, recommend movies to the user that have a high weighted rating (according to the IMDB formula) and that satisfy the preceding conditions </li>
